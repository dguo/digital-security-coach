# Digital Security Coach [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/dguo/digital-security-coach.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/dguo/digital-security-coach)
[Digital Security Coach](https://www.digitalsecuritycoach.com/) is a crash
course on digital security. It is primarily intended for the average person who
doesn't know what the difference is between
[MD5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5) and
[bcrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt). The goal is to create an
accessible guide that doesn't assume a high level of technical knowledge and
recommends practical rather than comprehensive solutions.

Digital Security Coach's philosophy is that it is more important to convince
grandparents to use a password manager than to convince software developers to
set up their own VPN servers. Editorial decisions for this site should be guided
by this philosophy.

The site was originally created as an entry for [Have I been
pwned?](https://haveibeenpwned.com/)'s [API
contest](https://www.troyhunt.com/do-something-awesome-with-have-i-been-pwned-and-win-a-lenovo-thinkpad/).
